In order to prevent conflicts with Apple's own libtool we have prepended a "g"

==> Caveats

Python modules have been installed and Homebrew's site-packages is not
in your Python sys.path, so you will not be able to import the modules
this formula installed. If you plan to develop with these modules,
please run:
  mkdir -p /home/ec2-user/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
  echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' >> /home/ec2-user/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/homebrew.pth
