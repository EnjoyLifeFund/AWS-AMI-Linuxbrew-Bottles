==> make install
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall fish`
==> Caveats
You will need to add:
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/fish
to /etc/shells.

Then run:
  chsh -s /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/fish
to make fish your default shell.
