==> ./configure --prefix=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/bash-completion@2/2.7 --sysconfdir=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc
==> make install
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall bash-completion@2`
==> Caveats
Add the following to your ~/.bash_profile:
  if [ -f /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
    . /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
  fi
